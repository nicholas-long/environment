# script for updating blog

- concept of `script for updating blog`
- call this from the server
- i am unable to get the blog to build on the server. jekyll will not work when installed from ubuntu. i even tried it in a kali linux docker.

```bash
# this works but it should be cleaned out too
sudo cp -r public/* /var/www/html/
```
