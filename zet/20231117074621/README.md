## what kinds of things could be automated
- testing credentials on all services every time new ones are found
  - learn from first attempt here https://github.com/nicholas-long/credpanda
- finding hardcoded credentials in code - use linpeas logic on directory?
- web dirbusting - i don't like how feroxbuster works exactly...
  - wrap wfuzz and use increasingly complex wordlists, scanning each subdirectory
