# script to print the content of markdown text within the heading level of a particular line

- concept of `script to print the content of markdown text within the heading level of a particular line`
- originally used this for kb to only display part of a document
  - [20230912192810](/zet/20230912192810/README.md) script to search zk markdown in command line
  - now with zk style notes, the content is usually not pages long and nested within tons of headings

```
/home/parallels/kb/awk-scripting/print-markdown-content-nested-in-heading.awk # print nested markdown content within headings
cp /home/parallels/kb/awk-scripting/print-markdown-content-nested-in-heading.awk .
```
