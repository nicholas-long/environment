# getting jekyll to work in the workflow of publishing a blog

- where do you put images in a jekyll blog?
- links
  - jekyll does not work with obsidian format links `[[title]]`
  - if you use regular links, you have to figure out manually where your blog post will be on the server which is annoying
- 2023-11-19 i have decided to use hugo instead of jekyll
