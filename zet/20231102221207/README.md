# working with openai chatgpt prompts

- concept of `testing openai chatgpt prompts`
- i have been hearing about crafting GPT prompts lately. you can create an assistant by feeding the history back in with the prompt, kind of like how it works with a recurrent neural network except with just text content

```bash
pip3 install openai-cli
```
