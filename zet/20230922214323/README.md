# this environment

- concept of this environment located at https://github.com/nicholas-long/environment and a place to add notes about it
- having it structured like a zettelkasten makes it feel like it is coming alive
- the idea is that scripts and projects start expanding and growing in complexity, but they also tend to tie into each other. this seems like the best way to store and work with all your scripts.
  - case in point: the kb repository with 10 months of notes has over 100 scripts, some tie together

# guidelines for enrich scripts within this environment

- refer to shortcut commands by relative path
  - right now, the environment is not installed on github runners, so shortcut commands will not run within the enrich steps.
  - these commands should be referred to by relative path assuming the working directory is the root of the repository
- don't use `find -executable` because it doesn't work on Mac OS, use script instead

```
```
