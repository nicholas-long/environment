# script to search zk markdown in command line

- concept of `script to search zk markdown in command line`
- exactly the same as the `k` command from my pen test environment
  - https://github.com/nicholas-long/pen-test-environ/blob/main/tmux-scripts/searchmarkdown.sh
- need to define something like `ZK_PATH` to make it work

```
alias k='~/tmux-scripts/searchmarkdown.sh -q "^# " ~/kb'

```
