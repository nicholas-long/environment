# script to sync only markdown files from zk to github

- [ ] implement github zk markdown sync script
- concept of `script to sync only markdown files from zk to github`
- i need to get access to scripts and commands and stuff, but obsidian sync is so slow
- image and pdf files are too big to include in repo to keep size down
  - just need access to the raw text anyway for data or code snippets
- env var `ZK_PATH` tells the path for the script to search markdown - intended to be optional so far

```
