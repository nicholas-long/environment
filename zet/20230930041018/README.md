# fsdb future ideas

- cool future idea: join with another file or stream on a specific column
- future optimization: check if an ID exists in the database or not, using a bloom filter.
- future optimization: searching many can be more efficient if you can pair them up.
- future: recompress - maybe: rewrite all compressed streams as continuous gzip streams to optimize space?
