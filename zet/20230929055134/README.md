# attempt to create script logs from tmux panes

- concept of `attempt to create script logs from tmux panes`
- the idea was to record whole hacking sessions for later analysis
- could have possibly used on OSCP
- i think it is supposed to be the entrypoint into where your terminal session starts?

```bash
/home/parallels/kb/tmux/tmux-script-log.sh # attempt to create script logs from tmux panes
cp /home/parallels/kb/tmux/tmux-script-log.sh .
```
