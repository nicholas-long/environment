# script to package up program and debian dependencies a tar to install on a remote target machine

- concept of `script to package up program and debian dependencies a tar to install on a remote target machine`
- i usually can't install a deb file on a target machine on like hackthebox or something because no internet 
- deb files have dependencies. if you figure out all of them, you can build a tar full of deb files. installing them all should get the program installed.

```
/home/parallels/kb/linux/package-it-all.sh # attempt to package up all dependencies deb files into a tar to install on a remote target machine
cp /home/parallels/kb/linux/package-it-all.sh .
```
