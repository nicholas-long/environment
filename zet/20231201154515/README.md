# findings from converting to zettelkasten and converting formats

- i converted every heading to a card when doing my conversion process <https://github.com/nicholas-long/markdown-raw-files-to-zettelkasten-conversion>
  - the card structure that i created is like a tree from every document where the headings link together.
  - some headings are just for organizational purposes and this creates completely empty cards
  - it is a kind of a pain to combine these thousands of files back together while new content is being continuously added
- when converting markdown files, even big ones, one file should be equal to one card.
  - it is always possible to split up later,
  - it is fine for cards to be big enough to have real content in them
  - small cards with a few details are okay in moderation, but that should not be the preferred way
- having all two-way backlinks inside a personal zk for every card might be overwhelming.
  - i like that there are one way links supported in obsidian but that backlinks are also visible as needed
  - otoh, 2 way links can keep things from getting lost. i think they are perfect for a medium to large sized project.
- obsidian already has a great workflow for working on your phone, so it is foolish to try to only ever work in the terminal
- it is practical to use different things on different devices such as using Obsidian on my phone and using ZKVR in the Linux terminal
  - private zk - Obsidian
  - private hacking/development notes - zkvr
  - public environment - zkvr
