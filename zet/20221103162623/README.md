# move zetcmd to wrapper CLI and remove fzf subcommands from CLI

- concept of `move zetcmd to wrapper CLI`
- remove fzf subcommands from CLI
- 2023-10-06 at this point i would like to move all the command line zet parts and graph browser into a subcommand implementation
  - but i am not very interested in developing that project much further. maybe i can use zkvr with some simple github compatible zk implementations

```
