# testing environment on netbook

- need to get rid of on-screen keyboard
  - [20230922222809](/zet/20230922222809/README.md) getting rid of on-screen keyboard
- i can work on it for a couple hours and it is still at 60%
- 2023-10-06 this is a lot better now that i have access to info from my private zk to copy and paste
  - [20231005211810](/zet/20231005211810/README.md) script to sync only markdown files from zk to github
- using input remapper to fix integrated mouse button issues https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper
  - can also turn the nub into a scroll wheel which feels really cyberpunk
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper.git
```
- regularly crashes when receiving touch input on the menu bar in gnome.
