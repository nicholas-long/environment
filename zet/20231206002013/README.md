# webssh environment issues

- [x] tmux hotkey does not work. need a backup to convert it to ctrl-b.
  - maybe like a hotkey that loads a different tmux config
  - [20230905015107](/zet/20230905015107/README.md) tmux config
- created script `zet/20231206002013/fix-tmux-hotkey` to change hotkey back
  - added to bashrc as shortcut

- this works to change the hotkey back and forth between Ctrl-A and Ctrl-Space
```bash
fixtmux on
fixtmux off
```
