- `toggle-case-combinatoric.awk` - print all variations of upper and lower case for given lowercase string
- `base64-every-line.awk` - base64 encode lines individually
- `combine-files.awk` - combine lines from two files combinatorically with symbol between
- `live-combine.awk` - combine lines with all previous lines combinatorically
